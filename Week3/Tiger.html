 <h3>TIGER</h3>
<P> </P>
               

<p>The tiger is a large cat and a member of the genus Panthera native to Asia. It has a powerful, muscular body with 
    a large head and paws, a long tail and orange fur with black, mostly vertical stripes</p>
               
<P>Throughout the tiger's range, it inhabits mainly forests, from coniferous and temperate broadleaf and mixed 
    forests in the Russian Far East and Northeast China to tropical and subtropical moist broadleaf forests on the
    Indian subcontinent and Southeast Asia. The tiger is an apex predator and preys mainly on ungulates, which it
    takes by ambush. It lives a mostly solitary life and occupies home ranges, defending these from individuals of
    the same sex</P>
    
<P>The tiger is among the most popular of the world's charismatic megafauna. It has been kept in captivity since ancient
    times and has been trained to perform in circuses and other entertainment shows. </P>
